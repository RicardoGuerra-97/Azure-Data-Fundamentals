Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.

* Return a table with nine rows and five columns.
* The five columns should be aliased as: stay, count_int, average_phq, average_scs, and average_as, in that order.
* The average columns should contain the average of the todep (PHQ-9 test), tosc (SCS test), and toas (ASISS test) columns for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places.
* The count_int column should be the number of international students for each length of stay.
* Sort the results by the length of stay in descending order.
