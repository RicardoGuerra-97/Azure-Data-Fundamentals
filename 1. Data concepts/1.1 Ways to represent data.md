***Structured data***

_Structured data is data that adheres to a fixed schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties. Most commonly, the schema for structured data entities is tabular in other words, the data is represented in one or more tables that consist of rows to represent each instance of a data entity, and columns to represent attributes of the entity. For example, the following image shows tabular data representations for Customer and Product entities._

***Semi-structured***

_Semi-structured data is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances. For example, while most customers may have an email address, some might have multiple email addresses, and some might have none at all._

```json

// Customer 1
{
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Jones",
  "address":
  {
    "streetAddress": "1 Main St.",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10099"
  },
  "contact":
  [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 123-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "joe@litware.com"
    }
  ]
}

```

***Unstructured data***

_Not all data is structured or even semi-structured. For example, documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure. This kind of data is referred to as unstructured data._
