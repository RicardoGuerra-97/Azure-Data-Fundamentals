***Common formats for data files***

_The ability to store data in files is a core element of any computing system. Files can be stored in local file systems on the hard disk of your personal computer, and on removable media such as USB drives; but in most organizations, important data files are stored centrally in some kind of shared file storage system. Increasingly, that central storage location is hosted in the cloud, enabling cost-effective, secure, and reliable storage for large volumes of data._

* Delimited text files like csv
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
* Extensible Markup Language (XML)
* Binary Large Object (BLOB)

*Optimized file formats*

_While human-readable formats for structured and semi-structured data can be useful, they're typically not optimized for storage space or processing. Over time, some specialized file formats that enable compression, indexing, and efficient storage and processing have been developed.

* *_Avro_* is a row-based format. It was created by Apache. Each record contains a header that describes the structure of the data in the record. This header is stored as JSON.

* *_ORC_* (Optimized Row Columnar format) organizes data into columns rather than rows. It was developed by HortonWorks for optimizing read and write operations in Apache Hive (Hive is a data warehouse system that supports fast data summarization and querying over large datasets).

* *_Parquet_* is another columnar data format. It was created by Cloudera and X. A Parquet file contains row groups. Data for each column is stored together in the same row group. Each row group contains one or more chunks of data.

***Types of databases***

*_Relational databases_* are commonly used to store and query structured data. The data is stored in tables that represent entities, such as customers, products, or sales orders. Each instance of an entity is assigned a primary key that uniquely identifies it; and these keys are used to reference the entity instance in other tables. For example, a customer's primary key can be referenced in a sales order record to indicate which customer placed the order. The tables are managed and queried using Structured Query Language (SQL), which is based on an ANSI standard, so it's similar across multiple database systems.

*_Non-relational databases_* are data management systems that don’t apply a relational schema to the data. Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL database, even though some support a variant of the SQL language. There are four common types of Non-relational database commonly in use.

* Key-value databases in which each record consists of a unique key and an associated value, which can be in any format.

  * Document databases, which are a specific form of key-value database in which the value is a JSON document (which the system is optimized to parse and query).

* Column family databases, which store tabular data comprising rows and columns, but you can divide the columns into groups known as column-families. Each column family holds a set of columns that are logically related together.

* Graph databases, which store entities as nodes with links to define relationships between them.
