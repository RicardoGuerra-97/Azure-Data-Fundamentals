_There's a wide variety of roles involved in managing, controlling, and using data. Some roles are business-oriented, some involve more engineering, some focus on research, and some are hybrid roles that combine different aspects of data management. Your organization may define roles differently, or give them different names, but the roles described in this unit encapsulate the most common division of tasks and responsibilities._

The three key job roles that deal with data in most organizations are:

* *_Database administrators_* manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data, and restoring data in the event of a failure.

* *_Data engineers_* manage infrastructure and processes for data integration across the organization, applying data cleaning routines, identifying data governance rules, and implementing pipelines to transfer and transform data between systems.

* *_Data analysts_* explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts that enable organizations to make informed decisions.
