_Analytical data processing typically uses read-only (or read-mostly) systems that store vast volumes of historical data or business metrics. Analytics can be based on a snapshot of the data at a given point in time, or a series of snapshots._

1. Operational data is extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) into a data lake for analysis.
2. Data is loaded into a schema of tables - typically in a Spark-based data lakehouse with tabular abstractions over files in the data lake, or a data warehouse with a fully relational SQL engine.
3. Data in the data warehouse may be aggregated and loaded into an online analytical processing (OLAP) model, or cube. Aggregated numeric values (measures) from fact tables are calculated for intersections of dimensions from dimension tables. For example, sales revenue might be totaled by date, customer, and product.
4. The data in the data lake, data warehouse, and analytical model can be queried to produce reports, visualizations, and dashboards.
Data lakes are common in large-scale data analytical processing scenarios, where a large volume of file-based data must be collected and analyzed.

*_Data Warehouses_* are an established way to store data in a relational schema that is optimized for read operations – primarily queries to support reporting and data visualization. 

*_Data Lakehouses_* are a more recent innovation that combine the flexible and scalable storage of a data lake with the relational querying semantics of a data warehouse. The table schema may require some denormalization of data in an OLTP data source (introducing some duplication to make queries perform faster).
