***Relational database***

_In a relational database, you model collections of entities from the real world as tables. An entity can be anything for which you want to record information; typically important objects and events.Relational tables are a format for structured data, and each row in a table has the same columns; though in some cases, not all columns need to have a value._

***Normalization***

_Term used by database professionals for a schema design process that minimizes data duplication and enforces data integrity._

While there are many complex rules that define the process of refactoring data into various levels (or forms) of normalization, a simple definition for practical purposes is:

1. Separate each entity into its own table.
2. Separate each discrete attribute into its own column.
3. Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.
4. Use foreign key columns to link related entities.

***Explore SQL***

_SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and is used to communicate with a relational database. It's the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data in a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Oracle._
