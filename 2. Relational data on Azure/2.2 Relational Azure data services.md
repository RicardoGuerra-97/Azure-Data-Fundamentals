_Azure SQL is a collective term for a family of Microsoft SQL Server based database services in Azure._

Specific Azure SQL services include:

* **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) -** A virtual machine running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server. The use of a VM makes this option an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution that virtualizes hardware infrastructure for compute, storage, and networking in Azure; making it a great option for "lift and shift" migration of existing on-premises SQL Server installations to the cloud.

* **Azure SQL Managed Instance -** A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) option that provides near-100% compatibility with on-premises SQL Server instances while abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system. The service includes automated software update management, backups, and other maintenance tasks, reducing the administrative burden of supporting a database server instance.

* **Azure SQL Database -** A fully managed, highly scalable PaaS database service that is designed for the cloud. This service includes the core database-level capabilities of on-premises SQL Server, and is a good option when you need to create a new application in the cloud.

* **Azure SQL Edge -** A SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data.
