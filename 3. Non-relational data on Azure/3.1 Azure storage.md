***Azure blob storage***

_Azure Blob Storage is a service that enables you to store massive amounts of unstructured data as binary large objects, or blobs, in the cloud. Blobs are an efficient way to store data files in a format that is optimized for cloud-based storage, and applications can read and write them by using the Azure blob storage API. In an Azure storage account, you store blobs in containers. A container provides a convenient way of grouping related blobs together. You control who can read and write blobs inside a container at the container level._

Azure Blob Storage supports three different types of blob:

* *_Block blobs._* A block blob is handled as a set of blocks. Each block can vary in size, up to 4000 MiB. A block blob can contain up to 190.7 TiB (4000 MiB X 50,000 blocks). The block is the smallest amount of data that can be read or written as an individual unit. Block blobs are best used to store discrete, large, binary objects that change infrequently.

* *_Page blobs._* A page blob is organized as a collection of fixed size 512-byte pages. A page blob is optimized to support random read and write operations; you can fetch and store data for a single page if necessary. A page blob can hold up to 8 TB of data. Azure uses page blobs to implement virtual disk storage for virtual machines.

* *_Append blobs._* An append blob is a block blob optimized to support append operations. You can only add blocks to the end of an append blob; updating or deleting existing blocks isn't supported. Each block can vary in size, up to 4 MB. The maximum size of an append blob is just over 195 GB.

Blob storage provides three access tiers, which help to balance access latency and storage cost:

* *_The Hot_* tier is the default. You use this tier for blobs that are accessed frequently. The blob data is stored on high-performance media.

* *_The Cool_* tier has lower performance and incurs reduced storage charges compared to the Hot tier. Use the Cool tier for data that is accessed infrequently. It's common for newly created blobs to be accessed frequently initially, but less so as time passes. In these situations, you can create the blob in the Hot tier, but migrate it to the Cool tier later. You can migrate a blob from the Cool tier back to the Hot tier.

* *_The Archive_* tier provides the lowest storage cost, but with increased latency. The Archive tier is intended for historical data that mustn't be lost, but is required only rarely. Blobs in the Archive tier are effectively stored in an offline state. Typical reading latency for the Hot and Cool tiers is a few milliseconds, but for the Archive tier, it can take hours for the data to become available. To retrieve a blob from the Archive tier, you must change the access tier to Hot or Cool. The blob will then be rehydrated. You can read the blob only when the rehydration process is complete.

***Azure File storage***

_Azure Files is essentially a way to create cloud-based network shares, such as you typically find in on-premises organizations to make documents and other files available to multiple users. By hosting file shares in Azure, organizations can eliminate hardware costs and maintenance overhead, and benefit from high availability and scalable cloud storage for files._

Azure Files supports two common network file sharing protocols:

* *_Server Message Block (SMB)_* file sharing is commonly used across multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).

* *_Network File System (NFS)_* shares are used by some Linux and macOS versions. To create an NFS share, you must use a premium tier storage account and create and configure a virtual network through which access to the share can be controlled.

***Azure Tables storage***

_Azure Table Storage is a NoSQL storage solution that makes use of tables containing key/value data items. Each item is represented by a row that contains columns for the data fields that need to be stored. However, don't be misled into thinking that an Azure Table Storage table is like a table in a relational database. An Azure Table enables you to store semi-structured data. All rows in a table must have a unique key (composed of a partition key and a row key), and when you modify data in a table, a timestamp column records the date and time the modification was made; but other than that, the columns in each row can vary._

Partitioning not only helps to organize data, it can also improve scalability and performance in the following ways:

* Partitions are independent from each other, and can grow or shrink as rows are added to, or removed from, a partition. A table can contain any number of partitions.

* When you search for data, you can include the partition key in the search criteria. This helps to narrow down the volume of data to be examined, and improves performance by reducing the amount of I/O (input and output operations, or reads and writes) needed to locate the data.
