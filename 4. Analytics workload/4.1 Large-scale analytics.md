* *_1. Data ingestion and processing_*, data from one or more transactional data stores, files, real-time streams, or other sources is loaded into a data lake or a relational data warehouse. 

* *_2. Analytical data store_*, data stores for large scale analytics include relational data warehouses, file-system based data lakes, and hybrid architectures that combine features of data warehouses and data lakes (sometimes called data lakehouses or lake databases). We'll discuss these in more depth later.

* *_3. Analytical data model_*, while data analysts and data scientists can work with the data directly in the analytical data store, it’s common to create one or more data models that pre-aggregate the data to make it easier to produce reports, dashboards, and interactive visualizations. Often these data models are described as cubes, in which numeric data values are aggregated across one or more dimensions.

* *_4. Data visualization_*, data analysts consume data from analytical models, and directly from analytical stores to create reports, dashboards, and other visualizations. Additionally, users in an organization who may not be technology professionals might perform self-service data analysis and reporting.
