_Data processing is simply the conversion of raw data to meaningful information through a process._

There are two general ways to process data:

* *_Batch processing_*, in which multiple data records are collected and stored before being processed together in a single operation.
  
* *_Stream processing_*, in which a source of data is constantly monitored and processed in real time as new data events occur.


***General Architecture for stream processing***

At its simplest, a high-level architecture for stream processing looks like this:

* *_1. An event generates some data._* This might be a signal being emitted by a sensor, a social media message being posted, a log file entry being written, or any other occurrence that results in some digital data.
  
* *_2. The generated data_* is captured in a streaming source for processing. In simple cases, the source may be a folder in a cloud data store or a table in a database. In more robust streaming solutions, the source may be a "queue" that encapsulates logic to ensure that event data is processed in order and that each event is processed only once.
  
* *_3. The event data_* is processed, often by a perpetual query that operates on the event data to select data for specific types of events, project data values, or aggregate data values over temporal (time-based) periods (or windows) - for example, by counting the number of sensor emissions per minute.
  
* *_4. The results_* of the stream processing operation are written to an output (or sink), which may be a file, a database table, a real-time visual dashboard, or another queue for further processing by a subsequent downstream query.

***Real-time analytics services***

Microsoft supports multiple technologies that you can use to implement real-time analytics of streaming data, including:

* *_Azure Stream Analytics:_* A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution you can use to define streaming jobs that ingest data from a streaming source, apply a perpetual query, and write the results to an output.
* *_Spark Structured Streaming:_* An open-source library that enables you to develop complex streaming solutions on Apache Spark based services, including Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks.
* *_Microsoft Fabric:_* A high-performance database and analytics platform that includes Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Analytics, Data Warehouse, and Databases.
